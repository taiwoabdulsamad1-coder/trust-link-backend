# TrustLink Backend — Specification Requirements Document (SRD)

> **Purpose**: This document is the authoritative specification for the TrustLink Backend. Every code change MUST conform to these requirements. It serves as the contract between maintainers and contributors — any PR that violates these specifications MUST be rejected.

---

## 1. Project Overview

### 1.1 Purpose

TrustLink Backend is a NestJS application that manages **escrow transactions on the Stellar blockchain**. It enables secure peer-to-peer commerce by holding funds in escrow, tracking physical shipment via logistics providers, and automatically releasing funds upon delivery confirmation.

### 1.2 Scope

The system covers:
- Escrow lifecycle management (creation → funding → shipping → delivery → release)
- SEP-10 Stellar wallet authentication with JWT issuance and refresh token rotation
- Logistics tracking (GIGL, Terminal Africa, with carrier auto-detection)
- Automated fund release (48 hours after delivery confirmation)
- Dispute resolution (buyer-initiated, admin-mediated)
- Webhook receiver for Stellar Horizon events
- Vendor management (profiles, analytics, notification preferences)
- Admin operations (stats, dispute resolution, queue monitoring, DLQ management)

### 1.3 Out of Scope

- Frontend applications (separate repositories)
- Smart contract development (Soroban contracts are deployed independently)
- Stellar Horizon infrastructure
- Third-party logistics provider infrastructure

---

## 3. Architecture Specification

### 3.1 Module Structure

Every feature MUST follow the NestJS module convention:

```
src/<feature>/
├── <feature>.module.ts        # @Module decorator, imports, providers, exports
├── <feature>.controller.ts    # HTTP routes only — no business logic
├── <feature>.service.ts       # Business logic only — no HTTP/DB direct calls
├── <feature>.repository.ts    # Database access only — Prisma queries
└── dto/                       # Request/response validation DTOs
```

**Rules**:
- R-ARCH-01: Controllers must only parse input, call service, return response. No business logic.
- R-ARCH-02: Services must contain business logic. No direct Prisma calls.
- R-ARCH-03: Repositories must contain all database queries. No business logic.
- R-ARCH-04: Stellar SDK calls must only live in `src/stellar/`. No `stellar-sdk` imports elsewhere.
- R-ARCH-05: Background workers must live in `src/workers/`. No `setInterval` in services.
- R-ARCH-06: Shared guards, filters, middleware must live in `src/common/`.

### 3.2 Layer Boundaries

```
HTTP Request
  │
  ├─ Middleware (Security, Logger, RequestId)
  ├─ Guard (JwtGuard, AdminGuard, ThrottlerGuard)
  ├─ Pipe (ValidationPipe, SanitizationPipe)
  ├─ Controller (parse DTO, delegate to service)
  ├─ Service (business logic, orchestration)
  │    ├─ Repository (Prisma queries)
  │    ├─ CacheService (Redis read/write)
  │    └─ External services (Stellar, SendGrid, Twilio, Logistics)
  └─ Filter (GlobalExceptionFilter → consistent error response)
```

### 3.3 Escrow State Machine

```
CREATED → FUNDED → SHIPPED → DELIVERED → COMPLETED/RELEASED
                                      ↘ DISPUTED → RELEASED/REFUNDED
CREATED/FUNDED → CANCELLED
```

R-ARCH-07: All state transitions must be validated against the state machine. Invalid transitions must throw `BadRequestException`.
R-ARCH-08: Every state transition must log an `EscrowEvent` record.
R-ARCH-09: State transitions must invalidate Redis cache immediately.

### 3.4 Background Workers

| Worker | Interval | Responsibility |
|---|---|---|
| AutoReleaseWorker | 5 minutes | Release escrows delivered 48+ hours ago |
| TrackingPollWorker | 10 minutes | Poll logistics providers for delivery updates |

R-ARCH-10: Workers must implement `OnModuleInit` / `OnApplicationShutdown` for clean startup/shutdown.
R-ARCH-11: Workers must handle per-escrow errors independently — one failure must not block the batch.
R-ARCH-12: Workers must use optimistic locking to prevent concurrent duplicate processing.

R-AUTH-01: Authentication must use Stellar SEP-10 challenge-response protocol.
R-AUTH-02: Challenge nonces must be stored in the database with a single-use flag.
R-AUTH-03: Nonces must expire after 15 minutes (configurable via NONCE_TTL).
R-AUTH-04: Used or expired nonces must reject with `UnauthorizedException`.
R-AUTH-05: JWT tokens must be signed with HS256 using SEP10_JWT_SECRET (min 32 chars).

### 4.2 JWT Structure

```
Header:  { alg: "HS256", typ: "JWT" }
Payload: { sub: "<stellar-address>", iat: <unix-epoch>, exp: <unix-epoch + 3600> }
```

R-AUTH-06: JWT expiry must be 1 hour.
R-AUTH-07: JWT must include `role: 'admin'` claim when the user address matches ADMIN_ADDRESS.

### 4.3 Authorization

R-AUTH-08: `JwtGuard` must verify the HMAC-SHA256 signature of every JWT. Tokens with invalid signatures must return 401.
R-AUTH-09: `AdminGuard` must check both the JWT role claim and address against ADMIN_ADDRESS.
R-AUTH-10: Vendor-scoped endpoints (ship, cancel, escrow list) must verify the authenticated user owns the resource.
R-AUTH-11: Cross-vendor access attempts must return 403 Forbidden.

### 4.4 Refresh Token Rotation

R-AUTH-12: Refresh tokens must be single-use with family-based revocation.
R-AUTH-13: Reuse of a revoked refresh token must invalidate the entire token family.
R-AUTH-14: Refresh tokens must expire after 7 days (configurable via REFRESH_TOKEN_TTL).

## 7. Testing Specification

### 7.1 Test Coverage Requirements

R-TST-01: Every service method must have at least one unit test.
R-TST-02: Every controller endpoint must have at least one integration test.
R-TST-03: Every critical user flow must have an E2E test.
R-TST-04: Coverage of application source (`src/`, excluding spec files
and `main.ts`) must meet separate floors for lines (70%), branches (64%),
and functions (65%), enforced by `scripts/check_coverage.js`. Coverage is
measured over application source only. Do not widen `collectCoverageFrom` to
include specs, scripts or config, which inflates the denominator and makes the
gate meaningless.
R-TST-05: PRs that reduce coverage by more than 2% must be rejected.

### 7.2 Test Types

| Test Type | Location | What It Tests | Dependencies |
|---|---|---|---|
| Unit | `test/unit/` | Single service/repository in isolation | All mocks via Jest |
| Integration | `test/integration/` | Full module with real DB | PostgreSQL (in-memory or Docker) |
| E2E | `test/` | HTTP request → response cycle | PostgreSQL + full app bootstrap |

R-TST-06: Unit tests must mock all external dependencies (Prisma, Stellar SDK, HTTP clients).
R-TST-07: Integration tests must use a real or in-memory database, not mocked Prisma.
R-TST-08: E2E tests must use `supertest` against the bootstrapped NestJS app.
R-TST-09: Tests must not depend on external network access (Stellar, logistics APIs, etc.).
R-TST-10: Tests must be deterministic — same inputs must always produce same outputs.

### 7.3 Critical Test Paths

The following paths MUST have test coverage:

- R-TST-11: SEP-10 challenge generation and verification
- R-TST-12: JWT signature verification (valid → accept, forged → reject)
- R-TST-13: Admin authorization (admin → 200, vendor → 403)
- R-TST-14: Escrow state machine transitions (all valid and invalid paths)
- R-TST-15: Auto-release optimistic locking (concurrent access)
- R-TST-16: Webhook HMAC verification (valid → accept, tampered → reject)
- R-TST-17: Refresh token rotation (valid → rotate, reused → revoke family)
- R-TST-18: Rate limit enforcement (within limit → 200, exceeded → 429)
