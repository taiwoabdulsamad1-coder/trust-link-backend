# Production Deployment Guide

## Overview

This guide defines the production deployment order for the Trust-Link backend. Use it for staging and production releases so infrastructure, database migrations, service rollout, and validation happen in a consistent sequence.

## Infrastructure Prerequisites

- Node.js 22 runtime (the version pinned by `.nvmrc` and both Docker stages).
- PostgreSQL 16 (the version used by Docker Compose and CI).
- Redis for response and tracking cache when `REDIS_URL` is configured.
- Stellar Horizon access for the selected network.
- SendGrid and Twilio credentials when notifications are enabled.
- HTTPS termination at the load balancer or ingress.
- Centralized log collection for JSON logs.
- OpenTelemetry collector when tracing is enabled.

## Environment Rules

Set all required variables before running migrations or starting the service:

- `NODE_ENV=production`
- `PORT`
- `DATABASE_URL`
- `SEP10_JWT_SECRET`
- `ADMIN_ADDRESS`
- `STELLAR_NETWORK`
- `STELLAR_WEBHOOK_SECRET`
- `REDIS_URL`
- `ALLOWED_ORIGINS`
- `API_BASE_URL`
- `SENDGRID_API_KEY`
- `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID`
- `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN`
- `OTEL_ENABLED`
- `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT`
- `CREDENTIAL_ENCRYPTION_KEY` (64-character hex string for logistics API key encryption)

Keep secrets in the deployment platform secret manager. Do not bake them into images, workflow files, or migration scripts.

## OpenAPI schema

Swagger UI is intentionally disabled when `NODE_ENV=production`. Production
operators and API consumers should obtain the generated schema from the CI
OpenAPI artifact or run `npm run openapi:generate` against the release source.

## Docker Compose Production Deployment

The `docker-compose.yml` includes a production profile optimized for production deployments. To use the production profile:

### Prerequisites

1. Create a `.env` file with production secrets:
   ```bash
   SEP10_JWT_SECRET=your-production-jwt-secret-at-least-32-chars
   ADMIN_ADDRESS=your-admin-stellar-address
   POSTGRES_PASSWORD=your-secure-postgres-password
   CREDENTIAL_ENCRYPTION_KEY=64-character-hex-string-for-encryption
   OTEL_ENABLED=false
   OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=
   ```

2. Ensure the `CREDENTIAL_ENCRYPTION_KEY` is exactly 64 hex characters (32 bytes). Generate one with:
   ```bash
   node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"
   ```

### Starting Production Services

```bash
# Start with production profile
docker-compose --profile production up -d

# View logs
docker-compose --profile production logs -f

# Stop services
docker-compose --profile production down
```

### Production Profile Features

- **Restart Policy**: `restart: always` for automatic recovery
- **Resource Limits**: CPU and memory limits for each service
- **Logging**: JSON-file driver with log rotation (10MB max, 3 files)
- **Health Checks**: All services include health checks with proper dependency ordering
- **No Development Mounts**: Source code volume mounts removed for security
- **Non-root User**: Application runs as `nestjs` user (UID 1001)

### Service Health Checks

- **PostgreSQL**: Uses `pg_isready` to verify database connectivity
- **Redis**: Uses `redis-cli ping` to verify Redis is responding
- **Application**: Uses three HTTP endpoints — pick the right one for each job:

| Endpoint          | Semantics    | When to use                                                                                                |
| ----------------- | ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `GET /health/live`| **Liveness** | Kubernetes/container-orchestrator `livenessProbe`. Always returns 200 if the HTTP stack is up; NO dependency checks. A failure here means "restart the container". Never triggers a restart because an upstream dependency is briefly down. |
| `GET /health/ready` | **Readiness** | Kubernetes/container-orchestrator `readinessProbe` and load-balancer target-group health. Runs full dependency checks (PostgreSQL + Horizon, Redis reported but optional). Returns 503 when required dependencies are unreachable, so the instance is removed from rotation temporarily. |
| `GET /health`    | **Legacy**   | Alias for `/health/ready` (readiness semantics). Preserved for backwards compatibility with existing monitors; new deployments should prefer the two endpoints above. |

#### Orchestrator example (Kubernetes probes)

```yaml
livenessProbe:
  httpGet:
    path: /health/live
    port: http
  initialDelaySeconds: 10
  periodSeconds: 10
  timeoutSeconds: 2
  failureThreshold: 3

readinessProbe:
  httpGet:
    path: /health/ready
    port: http
  initialDelaySeconds: 5
  periodSeconds: 5
  timeoutSeconds: 2
  failureThreshold: 3
```

Load balancers (AWS ALB, GCP LB, nginx, etc.) should poll **`/health/ready`** (not `/health/live`) so an instance with a database outage is taken out of the pool instead of returning 5xx to real users.

The application service waits for both PostgreSQL and Redis to be healthy before starting, preventing crash-loops due to unavailable dependencies.

### Resource Limits

Production services have the following resource limits:

- **app-prod**: 1 CPU, 1GB memory (reserve: 0.5 CPU, 512MB)
- **db-prod**: 1 CPU, 1GB memory (reserve: 0.5 CPU, 512MB)
- **redis-prod**: 0.5 CPU, 512MB memory (reserve: 0.25 CPU, 256MB)

## Migration Order

1. Confirm the target `DATABASE_URL` points at the production database.
2. Take a database backup and record the backup identifier in the release notes.
3. Run `npm ci` in a clean build environment.
4. Run `npm run db:generate`.
5. Apply migrations with `npm run db:migrate` or the platform migration job.
6. Verify Prisma can connect with a read-only health query.
7. Start one application instance against the migrated database.
8. Verify health, auth, escrow reads, admin reads, webhooks, and notification queues.
9. Roll out remaining instances after validation passes.

Never run application instances from a new build against an old schema when the release includes required schema changes.

## Pipeline Steps

1. Install dependencies: `npm ci`.
2. Type-check: `npm run typecheck`.
3. Lint: `npm run lint:check`.
4. Unit tests with coverage: `npm run test:cov`.
5. Coverage gate: `node scripts/check_coverage.js`.
6. Build: `npm run build`.
7. Build container image: `npm run docker:build`.
8. Run database migration job.
9. Deploy one canary instance.
10. Promote to full rollout after validation milestones pass.

## Validation Milestones

- The service starts without configuration warnings for required production variables.
- `GET /health/live` returns 200 (always, no dependencies touched).
- `GET /health/ready` returns 200 once database + Horizon are reachable; returns 503 when required dependencies are unavailable.
- `GET /health` (legacy alias) returns the same status code and body as `GET /health/ready`.
- `GET /version` returns the expected release version.
- SEP-10 challenge and verify flows issue tokens.
- Vendor escrow list queries return within the expected latency budget.
- Admin endpoints return 403 for vendor tokens and 200 for admin tokens.
- `PATCH /admin/dispute/:id/resolve` is reachable only by admin JWTs.
- Webhook signature validation rejects missing or invalid signatures.
- Queue dashboard and logs show no failed background jobs.
- Error rate and p95 latency remain stable for at least one canary window.

## Production Baseline Migration

The `20260526000000_initial` baseline migration creates the foundational tables (`Escrow`, `VendorProfile`, `Dispute`, `Notification`) and enums. All statements are idempotent (`IF NOT EXISTS`), making them safe on any database.

**If your production database was originally set up via `prisma db push`** (no `_prisma_migrations` table), you must run this one-time transition before the baseline is applied:

```bash
bash scripts/resolve-existing-migrations.sh
```

This script syncs the schema and marks all 14 existing migrations as applied, so subsequent `prisma migrate deploy` runs only apply new changes.

**If your production database already uses Prisma Migrate** (has `_prisma_migrations` records), no action is needed — the baseline migration is a no-op via `IF NOT EXISTS`.

## Automated DB Migration Workflow

The `.github/workflows/db-migrate.yml` workflow applies Prisma migrations automatically.

**Triggers:**
- Runs on every push to `main`
- Runs on pull requests (status check)
- Supports manual dispatch with a `dry_run` option via the GitHub Actions UI

**Dry run (preview without applying):**
1. Go to Actions → Database Migrations → Run workflow
2. Set `dry_run` to `true`
3. The workflow runs `prisma migrate status` to show pending migrations without applying them

**Migration status check:**
After every run (apply or dry run), `prisma migrate status` is executed so the log confirms which migrations were applied and the schema is in sync.

**Running migrations before integration / E2E tests:**
The `test.yml` workflow already runs `npx prisma migrate deploy` before executing tests. The dedicated `db-migrate.yml` workflow handles production deployments and previews independently.

## Rollback

1. Stop the rollout and keep the canary isolated.
2. Revert the application image to the previous release.
3. Restore the database from the pre-release backup when migrations are not backward-compatible.
4. Re-run health, auth, escrow, admin, and webhook validation.
5. Document the failing milestone before reopening rollout.

**Migration rollback procedure:**

Prisma does not support automatic down migrations. To roll back a schema change:

```bash
# 1. Restore from the pre-release database backup
pg_restore -U trustlink -d trustlink_prod backup_pre_release.dump

# 2. Revert to the previous application image and restart
# 3. Verify the application connects and passes health checks

# To mark a failed migration as rolled back in Prisma's migration table:
npx prisma migrate resolve --rolled-back <migration_name>
```

Always take a labelled database snapshot before applying migrations to a shared environment.
