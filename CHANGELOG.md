# Changelog

All notable changes to Trust-Link Backend are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Additional escrow and dispute lifecycle states for creation, cancellation, review, resolution, and abandonment.
- Production Docker Compose profile with service health checks, restart policies, resource limits, and log rotation.
- Optional `SEP10_SIGNING_SECRET` configuration for a dedicated, stable SEP-10 web-auth signing key.
- Required `PRESIGN_SECRET` configuration for a stable, configurable HMAC key used by `S3PresignService` so simulated pre-signed evidence URLs are reproducible across restarts and replicas.
- Database commands for safely applying migrations, resetting a local database, and idempotently seeding development data.
- Persistent notification delivery status and retry information.

### Changed

- `GiglClient` now rejects 2xx responses whose body does not match the expected `GiglTrackingResponse` schema, surfacing them as `GiglInvalidResponseError` instead of leaking bad payloads downstream. The new behaviour is exercised by the unit-test suite added alongside this change.

### Changed

- Escrow listings for vendors and buyers are cursor-paginated, return newest records first, and default to 20 records per page.
- Creating an escrow requires an `Idempotency-Key`; keys must be UUIDs and are scoped to the authenticated vendor.
- SEP-10 challenge signing now uses a configured key that remains stable across restarts and replicas.

### Fixed

- Auto-release transactions reload the Stellar account sequence before retrying and use an atomic claim to prevent duplicate submissions.
- Dispute creation invalidates the related escrow cache, and administrative dispute resolution records the dispute as resolved.
- Configured SendGrid and Twilio notification clients are now used when their credentials are available.
- Auto-release processing continues with other eligible escrows when an individual submission fails.

### Removed

- Support for using a raw Stellar address as a bearer token; API clients must send a valid, signed, unexpired SEP-10 JWT.

### Security

- Stress-test endpoints now require authenticated administrator access.
- Escrow contact details are rejected unless encrypted before persistence, and logistics API credentials are encrypted at rest.
- JWT validation fails closed when its signing secret is missing, malformed, expired, or has an invalid signature.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-06-27

### Added

- OpenTelemetry distributed tracing with OTLP export, database spans, and workflow-level context propagation ([#79](https://github.com/JSE-ORG/trust-link-backend/issues/79))
- Security policy with vulnerability disclosure procedures ([#90](https://github.com/JSE-ORG/trust-link-backend/issues/90))
- Incident response runbook for backup restoration and container recovery ([#97](https://github.com/JSE-ORG/trust-link-backend/issues/97))

### Changed

- `GET /health` and `GET /version` now report the semver from `package.json`
- `findAutoReleaseEligible` no longer double-subtracts time — the caller (`AutoReleaseService`) owns the 7-day cutoff calculation (#249)
- `NODE_ENV` in default `.env` changed from `test` to `development` so workers and rate limits initialise correctly during local development (#248)
- Strict Content-Security-Policy extended to allow required Stellar origin headers (#334)
- Dead code removed and log noise reduced across services (#354)

### Fixed
